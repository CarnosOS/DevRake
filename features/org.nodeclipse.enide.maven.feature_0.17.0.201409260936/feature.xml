      Enide Maven is alternative and completion to m2e (Maven Integration for Eclipse).

Launch build or execute Java class.
Project does not need to be Maven project. Just `pom.xml` would be enough.
(The project may be General, old classic Java, Eclipse plugin with Tycho, broken Maven or Gradle project.)

No miracles, this plugins just launches `mvn` with options, as you can do from command line.
Full path to maven `mvn.bat` or `mvn` is used, so you can try different versions.
Specify options to `mvn` that will be Workspace-wide.
Executed string is shown is Console, so you can check and learn.
